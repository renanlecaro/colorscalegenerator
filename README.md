# Color Scale Generator
Helps you experiment with a scale going from one hsv value to the other 

I needed a way to commicate vocabulary mastery via colors in https://mywords.netlify.app/ so I started creating a color scale 
going from bad (red) to good (green). After a bit of fidling around with the colors and reloading the app i got tired of the
overly long feedback loop and instead created this tiny tool to generate color scales between two colors. It's extremely basic
and focused on what i needed. I hope it might be usefull to others if they manage to find it.
